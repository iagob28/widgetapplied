# Widget + Moveit
This project is an integration off the widget that takes screenshot and details
of your problems and send to a moderator for email with the moveit project, wich
you can see here in my repositories.

## For NLW return students
Using the base learned on NLW returno by Rocketseat i did some increments, like,
the widget now has a light/dark mode all this automatic according to your browser,
the mail sended is now beeing sended to a real email address, in this case my own
iago_bortolon@hotmail.com, i used the lib mailgun for this, and i also change
a feel things on the received email, the size of the image is smaller and a 
clickable link to see the image in full in another tab.
